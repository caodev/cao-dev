Overview:
--------
By Default, the title of a taxonomy page is only the term itself. Though 
that's usually enough information to get the point across, it's not very 
user friendly. Additionally, for SEO reasons most people would probably 
prefer more words in the title than just the term itself.

Taxonomy Title adds an additional "Page Title" field allowing admins to 
configure a specific Page Title for each Taxonomy term.


Installation Instructions:
--------
- add this module to the sites/all/modules folder
- visit /admin/build/modules and enable taxonomy title
