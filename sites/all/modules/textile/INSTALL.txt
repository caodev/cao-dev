* For a new installation, copy the entire textile module directory to the
  appropriate module directory within your Drupal installation.

* Download the most up to date textile library from TextPattern [1]

* The library should be availble via a link on the right in tar.gz or zip
  formats. Uncompress the download, and place the classTextile.php file
  into the same directory as textile.module.

* Log into your site, enable the Textile module on the
  admin/build/modules page. Finally, you must add the Textile filter to
  the appropriate input formats and set any desired configuration options.

NOTE: you need to be careful with how your input filters are ordered. I
recommend setting up a special filter for textile. Disable the
line-break converter, and set up the HTML filter to run AFTER textile,
and only allow the types of tags you want to permit.
